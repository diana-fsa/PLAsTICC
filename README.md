In the file `code-PLAsTiCC.ipynb` there is the code with the data processing and the experiments with different classifiers.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/PLAsTiCC-2018/overview) was used in a competition to help astronomers classify astronomical sources that vary with time into different classes.

The training dataset of kaggle was divided in 80% for training and 20% for testing and was used in experiments with several classifiers, from neural networks to random forest. Also feature extraction was used, as well as feature selection and fine-tuning.

The final result was not bad with a 71.97% of accuracy with random forest.
