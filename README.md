In the file `code-PLAsTiCC.ipynb` there is the code with the data processing and the experiments with different classifiers.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/PLAsTiCC-2018/overview) was used in a competition to help astronomers classify astronomical sources that vary with time into different classes.
